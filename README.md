Identifying the trend in the sales of food items. So it helps the restaurant to predict the day-by-day food master menu. 
## Why this field?
A lot of food is being wasted across the country. Restaurants plan its menu according to the test behavior pattern of customers. Restaurants can get max profit with minimum utilization of resources.  <br>
All previously bill data is with restaurants. I used that data to build one master menu for a restaurant 
Many solutions are being suggested to solve this problem. AI is one among them and I strongly believe that AI can contribute a lot to this field. AI can not only solve problems in this field but it can also optimize the techniques that are being used for decades.

## TARGET SPECIFICATIONS:-
<ul>
<li>Customer satisfaction.</li>
<li>Reduced the cost of food.</li>

## Results from plots
<ul>
  <li>
    The customers come to the restaurant mostly during the 'Lunch' shift as evident from the shift count value.
    <li>One would assume that weekend count will be the most but the count for weekday is more. This is because it is the count of 5 weekdays to count of 2 weekend days.
    <li>Sales on all days is almost the same excepts Monday.
    <li>People come to the hotel to party as a group of 5. Based on this the hotel could give some discounts to party size of 5 to bring in more customers.
    <li>Breads is the most preferred food in the MenuCategory.
    <li>People order just one quantity most often.
    <li>Sales on almost all the months is the same.
    <li>Most customers come to eat around 12 which is inline with the higher 'Lunch' count.
    <li>Count for PM is more because the hotel opens around 11 AM.
    <li>Most of the customers go for vegetarian foods. Note that vegetarian includes sweets and snacks as well.
      </ul>
      
## Party size and regular


From the above plots we can find that there are serious deviations from the normal trend we saw earlier. Deviations:
<ul>
    <li>PartySize of 5 predominantly comes for dinner.
    <li>Weekends dominate weekday.
    <li>Sales on Saturday and Sunday are the highest which was not the case with the normal trend.
    <li>Breads is still the most preferred one but Desserts comes in second place whereas starter came in second place for the whole dataset.
    <li>Only hours 12 and 19 are the sales hours for PartySize of 5.
